# art-studies
A collection of study sketches

Each hour is a set of studies on different subjects (full body, torso, clothes, legs, hands) that I did for ✨ learning ✨. Feel free to use the png/psds as reference material, but do note that I am still learning so it's honestly not recommended as there are quite a few anatomy mistakes.
